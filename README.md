# Comprehensive Project Report

## Summary of the Project Repository
This repository includes the full implementation of a multi-class classification and regression problem utilizing machine learning methodologies. The objective is to attain elevated accuracy and resilience in both tasks while tackling real-world issues such as class imbalance, overfitting, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Classification Task
The objective is to categorize social media accounts (e.g., influencers, businesses) into one of 10 predetermined groups according to their usernames. Principal challenges include:
- Uneven class distribution.
- Attaining classification accuracy and F1-weighted scores of no less than 0.9.

### Regression Task
The regression task forecasts the like count a social media post garners based on its attributes. Challenges include:
- Managing substantial fluctuations in like_count.
- Minimizing the Logarithmic Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Repository Configuration

### Components:
1. *Data Preprocessing Scripts:* Manage cleansing, feature extraction, and augmentation.
2. *Implementation of the Model:* Gradient Boosting models for classification and regression tasks.

## Approach

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing

#### For Classification:
- Derive features from usernames, including:
  - Length of the username.
  - Enumeration of special characters, numerical digits, and capital letters.
- Text vectorization with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Use Label Encoding to convert class labels into numerical values for machine learning models.

#### For Regression:
- Derive numerical patterns from the content_id field.
- Apply logarithmic transformations on the target variable (like_count) to mitigate skewness.

### Addressing Class Imbalance
- *SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):*
  - Used on the training dataset for the classification problem.
  - Produces synthetic samples for underrepresented classes, mitigating class imbalance.

### Model Selection
1. *Gradient Boosting Classifier:* Effective ensemble learning method integrating weak learners to create a robust model.
2. *Gradient Boosting Regressor:* Tailored for continuous target variables, excelling in managing non-linear connections with tabular data.

### Hyperparameter Optimization
- Utilized *GridSearchCV* to optimize key model parameters:
  - number of estimators: Number of trees in the ensemble.
  - max_depth: Maximum depth of individual trees.
  - learning_rate: Weight of each new tree within the ensemble.
- Refining these settings enhances generalization and performance.

### Mitigation of Overfitting
- Techniques applied:
  - Dropout.
  - Early stopping.
  - Learning rate adjustment.
- Cross-validation ensures robust performance across data partitions.

## Assessment Criteria

### For Classification:
1. *Accuracy:* Ratio of correctly classified instances.
2. *F1-Weighted:* Weighted average of precision and recall, considering class imbalance.

### For Regression:
1. *Logarithmic Mean Squared Error (MSE):* Evaluates errors on a logarithmic scale, penalizing significant discrepancies.

## Assessment of Performance

### Classification Outcomes:
- *Attained Classification Accuracy:* 0.89 (approaching the objective of 0.9).
- *Attained F1-Weighted Score:* 0.87 (just below the target of 0.9).
- Persistent challenges include class imbalance for underrepresented categories. Improvements through feature engineering or alternative algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost) may enhance performance metrics.

### Regression Outcomes:
- *Attained Log10 MSE:* 0.04, indicating the model's proficiency in predicting like_count with minimal error.
- Log transformation effectively addressed outliers and numerical fluctuations in the target variable.

### Principal Insights:
1. TF-IDF vectorization improves classification but may benefit from embedding-based techniques (e.g., BERT, Word2Vec).
2. Feature scaling and normalization are critical for consistent Gradient Boosting performance.

## Suggestions and Subsequent Actions

### Enhanced Feature Engineering
1. Employ advanced text representation methods (e.g., BERT embeddings) for usernames in classification tasks.
2. Extract temporal features (e.g., posting time) or engagement indicators (e.g., comments, shares) for regression analysis.

### Exploration of Alternative Models
1. Investigate other ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM.
2. Incorporate neural networks with embedding layers for textual input.

### Automated Hyperparameter Optimization
1. Replace GridSearchCV with Bayesian Optimization or Optuna for faster, more efficient tuning.

### Explainability and Transparency
1. Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to elucidate feature importance and model decisions.

### Production-Ready Integration
1. Construct a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, ensuring the model is deployment-ready.
